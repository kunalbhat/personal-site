          I'm a technically inclined builder that thrives in every stage of the
          product process &ndash; from early insights to delivery. My experience
          of almost two decades in roles in design, product management, and
          engineering makes me a true end-to-end contributor that leads through
          collaboration.

          At <a href="#">Aura</a>, I design for growth experimentation and lead
          product research to uncover our next big strategic opportunities.

          Prior to that, by way of <a href="#">Magic+Might</a>, I dove deep into
          the autonomous ride-hail space with <a href="#">Waymo</a>,
          understanding rider sentiments and designing for future states in the
          Waymo app.

          At Galactic, a seed-staged startup (investors included Redpoint,
          Bloomberg Beta and Betaworks, among others) I explored crypto and
          building tools for web3 users. During a very rough time for crypto, we
          pivoted from a debit card product to finally launching a{" "}

          Prior to that, I spent 6 years at PayPal building merchant experiences
          spanning from redefining the UX of{" "}
          <a href="#">Braintree's merchant dashboard</a> to going deep into the
          Identity domain. I launched Braintree's Enterprise SSO offering, broke
          ground on a merchant data platform, and led the Identity component of
          PayPal's cross-organizational platform unification efforts.

          Prior to that, I led design at Modest (

          acquired by PayPal) where we built a contextual commerce platform to
          help small and medium businesses launch quickly on native iOS and
          Android apps.

          Prior to that, I designed and built the first iterations of{" "}
          <a href="#">dscout's</a> mobile research platform.
        </p>

          Before all that, the formative years of my career were spent in
          innovation consulting for Samsung and the consumer electronics space.
