          I'm a technically inclined builder who thrives in every stage of the
          product process &ndash; from early insights to delivery. With nearly
          two decades of experience across design, product management, and
          engineering, I'm an end-to-end contributor who leads through
          collaboration.

          At Galactic, a seed-staged startup (investors included Redpoint,
          Bloomberg Beta and Betaworks, among others) I explored crypto and
          building tools for web3 users. During a very rough time for crypto, we
