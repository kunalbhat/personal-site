          I'm a technically inclined builder that thrives in every stage of the
          product process &ndash; from early insights to delivery. My experience
          of almost two decades in roles in design, product management, and
          engineering makes me a true end-to-end contributor that leads through
          collaboration.

          At <a href="#">Aura</a>, I design for growth experimentation and lead

          Prior to that, by way of <a href="#">Magic+Might</a>, I dove deep into

          Waymo app.

          2015 &ndash; 2021 I spent 6 years at PayPal building merchant
          experiences spanning from <a href="#">Braintree's Control Panel</a> to
          leading Braintree's Identity team during PayPal's platform unification
          efforts.
