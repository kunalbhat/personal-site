# Personal Website — Kunal Bhat

Welcome to the codebase for my personal site. It’s a simple, fast-loading site built to share a bit about me, my work, and ongoing projects.

## About Me

- **Role:** Senior Product Designer (with a background in product management + frontend engineering)
- **Focus:** Designing fintech + consumer experiences at scale
- **Current:** Aura/Home — leading app & frame design
- **Side projects:** Maker/engineering experiments, game design, personal data tools

## How the Site Is Built

- **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with Vercel hosting
- **Styling:** CSS modules (single `style.css`) and lightweight utility classes
- **Deployment:** Connected to GitHub → automatic Vercel deploys on `main`

## Goals of the Site

- Share a clean portfolio + background
- Experiment with new tools, interactions, and publishing flows
- Serve as a sandbox for lightweight side projects
